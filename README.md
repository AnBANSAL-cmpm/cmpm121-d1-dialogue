# CMPM 121 D1 Project

This is the starting point for your CMPM 121 D1 project. The goal of this project is to create a simple web application using TypeScript, Vite, and modern web development practices. Students should make sure to remove _this_ content from their README.md file and replace it with their own project documentation.

The visual design and layout structure for this projectâ€™s interface (particularly the button styling, flexbox layout, and hover effects) were inspired by a public CSS example shared by another developer. Their original stylesheet provided ideas for organizing upgrade buttons and enhancing user feedback through color and animation. https://github.com/mrpoopers/D1rich/tree/main
